a merchant account is a type of bank account that allows businesses to accept payments
by debit or credit cards. so a merchant account is an agreement between a retailer, 
a merchant bank and payment processor for the settlement of credit and/or debit card
transactions.

when a customer pays for a product or service, the funds are first deposited into the 
merchant account and from there funds are eventually transferred to the business bank
account. transfers to the business account are normally done on a daily or weekly basis

an order is an object that is created as a result of a data flow between a buyer and a 
merchant and the financial institution during the order life cycle. these transactions
can be broken into two broad categories: PAYMENTS(monies transferred to the merchant from
the consumer), and CREDITS(monies returned to the buyer, such as when merchandise is defective).
As processing on an order continues, payment and credit objects are created, modified and destroyed.

another type of object used is a BATCH object. which represents multiple transactions processed
as a group, such as the deposit of all payments at the end of a business day. batch objects keep
track of the collections of transactions. for instance, if a financial institution tells the merchant
to close out the week's transactions, the merchant will close the current batch and open a new one.
batch objects for these two atches will reflect the new status of the batches.


1. at order submission, the ProcessOrder command calls the PrimePayment cmd to process payment since 
the order total amount needs to be processed. customize the getinitialamount method of ProcessOrder to get the total amount of this order.

2. the payment subsystem pre-processes payment and returns a shipment confirmation.

3. when the shipment confirmation is received, the order related info is udpdated.
the payment of order items to be shipped needs to be captured at this phase.
	a.command to update order related information
	b.in this command call ReservePayment and FinalizePayment to capture payment for this order
		to be shipped
		1. reservepayment - setorderid(orders_id)
				  - setreleases(shipmentlist) -> has map of all orderitems to ship rn
					its key is shipment id and value is totalamount
				  - setreservationamount(dshipmenttotal)
				  - execute()
		2. finalizepayment - setorderid(orders_id)
				   - setreleaseid(shipment_id)
				   - setfinalizationamount(shipmentamount)
				   - execute()


PAYMENT LIFE CYCLE - there are three stages to payment processing:VALIDATION, RESERVATION, and FINALIZATION. the payment
lifecycle is related to the order life cycle stages: ORDER CAPTURE, RELEASE to FFM and SHIPPING.
VALIDATION - ensures that a customer has adequate funds to make the purchase. the payment action depends on the customer's
		payment method. for instance when a customer pays for a purchase order using a credit card, a credit card
		authorization is sent and if it is valid, the transaction is approved. this process occurs during the order 
		submission.

RESERVATION - ensures that funds are available before shipment of the goods. the reservation amount is the sum of all 
		order release amounts. this process occurs during a release to fulfillment.

FINALIZATION - payment finalization is typically driven by a shipment confirmation message from or on behalf of the fulfiller.
		this process occurs when the goods are shipped for the order release.
		an order can have multiple releases if items in the order must be shipped from different warehouses or use
		different carriers. or if some of the items need to arrive at different times, such as for an expedited item.
		additionally, a customer can group order items in the same order to ship together including backordered items
		or future shipments.
